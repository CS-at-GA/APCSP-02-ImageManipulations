## Assignment

You will create three novel image filters. 

### Requirements
* Your project must respond to user input.
* Your project must have a way to revert to the original image. 
* Your project must include an algorithm that that changes all pixels _or_ all pixels in a user-definable area, in a color-based way. For instance, you could press 'b' and all the pixels would convert to a black and white image, or you could click and drag your mouse over an area, press 'b' and all the pixels in that area would convert to black and white. 
* Your project must include an algorithm that uses surrounding pixels to update a pixel's values. Blurring or scaling would be examples of this. 
* For each of the above filters, your algorithm must be implemented by *you* adjusting data on a pixel-by-pixel basis. You can not use any built in functionality. 

### _Some_ Ideas for Ways to Expand on This Project. 
* Saturate/desaturate
* Warping
* Pixelating 
* Advanced Blurring techniques
* Scaled effects
* Advanced masking
